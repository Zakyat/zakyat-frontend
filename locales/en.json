Basic needs are things that a person needs in order to preserve his life and freedom.

Therefore, after zakat becomes mandatory, the cost of the real estate transferred to the property and the rest of the movable and immovable property is calculated, and zakat is paid.

        "answer": "Since the company is a legal entity, it is not the company itself that pays the zakat, but its co-owners, if their share individually or together with the rest of their property, if any, reaches the size of a nisab. According to this, a person who has a nisab, in addition to basic necessities and money for basic needs, provided that the nisab is saved after a year, must pay zakat. Stationary equipment (machines, tools, etc.) of companies operating in industrial sector exempted from zakat. Working capital (semi-finished products, manufactured products, raw materials, cash, checks, etc.), together with net profit, is taxed with a 2.5% zakat after the financial value of obligations, expenses for materials, production, sales, is deducted management, financing. Consequently, the co-owner of such a company must pay zakat if the size of the nisab reaches its share in current assets and remains after a year, and not its share in fixed assets (offices, transport, office equipment). The same is true for companies operating in the field of trade. If shareholders delegate responsibilities for paying zakat to management, management can pay zakat from their share by proxy. In this case, the calculation of the value of zakat occurs as if the payer is an individual (the aggregate property of all co-owners is taken as the property of one person). If the company has not paid zakat with a share, the co-owners must do it themselves. Each year, according to the lunar calendar, a balance sheet is drawn up and an inventory is made. The cost of working capital, checks, obligations to the company is calculated, all this is summed up, the obligations of the company itself, if any, are deducted, and 2.5% of this amount is paid in the form of a zakat.",

If the dividends accruing to the shareholder in the event of making a profit, individually or together with the rest of his property, reach the size of nisab and remain after the end of the year, then zakat applies in the amount of 2.5%. If these shares were not acquired for the purpose of becoming their holder and receiving dividends, but for resale, they are regarded as property held for sale. If their price individually or together with the rest of the property to which zakat extends reaches nisab, then zakat is paid from them in the amount of 2.5% of their market value.",

However, according to some Hanafi scholars, only those debts whose due date has arrived and the payment of which has already begun to be demanded are deducted from the value of the property subject to the payment of zakat; debts whose return day has not yet arrived are not deductible. The full amount of such modern types of debt as credit, mortgage, contributions to housing cooperatives, etc., which are repaid over many years, is also deducted from the payment of zakat.",

        "answer": "From the standpoint of distribution or non-distribution of zakat payments to them, obligations to the lender are divided into three categories: 1. Reliable / strong debt. This is the money that the lender transferred to others as a debt or a debt formed as a result of the sale of goods on credit. If this debt is recognized by the debtor or there is a categorical argument confirming its existence, then the lender is obliged to pay zakat from it annually (subject to the remaining conditions of zakat). If zakat has not been paid over the past years, it will be reimbursed after receiving the debt. 2. Debt of medium reliability / average debt. This is a debt formed from income from property not intended for sale. Such as rent for an apartment. In the case of this debt, a refund for past unpaid zakat is also realized. However, in order for their repayment to become mandatory, the amount of the already repaid debt must reach the size of the nisab. 3. Unreliable debt / weak debt. This category includes probate payments, mahra, diya. Debts of this kind were not formed as a result of the exchange of goods. Their availability does not require reimbursement of unpaid zakat over the past years. Zakat from these debts is paid in a year from the moment of their repayment. There is no need for the annual payment of zakat from debt that is not recognized by the debtor, and debt, the probability of return of which is extremely small. If such a seemingly hopeless debt is nevertheless repaid, zakat is paid only for one year from the date of repayment. There is no need to pay zakat over the past years.",

Moreover, the person will not make the transfer / Tamilik by preparing food and announcing that the poor can feed it, or by feeding them. However, if the same food is prepared and handed over to the poor with the intention of paying zakat, tamlik will be implemented, that is, zakat will be paid. According to which, in the case when a person, giving money in debt, does not intend to pay zakat thereby, and later decides to do so, tamlik is not carried out, since the money itself is not available at that moment. Therefore, payment of zakat will not take place in that in the case when someone, having loaned money, later decides to forgive this debt with the intention of paying off zakat in this way. Scientists of all four madhhabs adhere to this opinion.",

        "answer": "Zakat can be paid on property such as food and clothing as part of this property, the same provision applies to money, currency and gold. A check or a receipt is a document informing that a property or money belongs to a specific person, drawn up between two or more persons. Consequently, they represent property or money in the amount prescribed in them. For this reason, a rich person who is under the obligation to pay zakat can transfer a check or receipt that is reliable in his conviction to the poor on account of this payment. However, the responsibility is removed from this person only after the poor have received the money. If payment by receipt does not occur, payment of zakat will need to be repeated.",

        "answer": "Zakat extends to agricultural products. “Ushr”, lexically meaning “one-tenth,” as a religious term means zakat, paid from agricultural products. This decision was approved by Kurjan and Sunna. Allah Almighty says: “O believers! Spend from the goods you have obtained and from what We have grown for you from the earth! Do not try to spend (for good purposes) bad things that you yourself would not take, unless with your eyes closed. And know that Allah is the One who does not need anyone and needs nothing, Praised ”(surah al-Bakar, ayat 267); “And He is the One who created gardens (with plants) spreading on the earth (like a watermelon) and not spreading (rising above the surface of the earth, like trees and shrubs), date palms and (all kinds of) cereals with different tastes, olives and pomegranates, having (some) similarities (in color and taste) and differences (in color, taste, size and smell). Eat (all) these fruits when they ripen, and pay tribute ('ushr and zakat) on the harvest day. But do not be wasteful (giving too much and leaving your families in need), because He does not like the wasteful ”(sura al-An'am, verse 141). The zakat size of these products is determined directly by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. One noble hadeeth says: “Those lands that are irrigated by rains, underground water or other natural means should be tithed, and half that is required from lands requiring artificial irrigation” (Bukhari, Zakat, 55).",

The size of nisab in such agricultural products suitable for long-term storage as wheat, barley, corn, rice is five vaskas. In modern units of measurement, this value ranges between 653 and 1000 kg. For example, this corresponds to 653 kg. wheat. In the remaining products, nisab is equal to their amount equivalent to the cheapest five vaskas of the above products.

At the same time, 'land from the land leased under the partnership agreement will be paid by the lessor and tenant in direct proportion to their shares. Each of them will pay ushr with the products he has got. Gratuitous transfer of land for use to the poor or relatives with the intention of doing a good deed, maintaining family ties and for other reasons, is an act to which our religion calls.

If the owner of this money is unknown, it is necessary to get rid of it by distributing it to the poor or charitable organizations, without expecting any reward for it (savaba). Thus, zakat does not apply to money received illegally, because they are discarded from themselves by returning to the true owner or wasting to charity.",

        "answer": "People on whom zakat is spent are indicated in Noble Kurjan. “(Mandatory) donations (called zakat) are given only to the poor (who don’t have enough money) and the poor (those who don’t have the means to live), to those who collect them (and also distribute and keep records of zakat), and whose hearts (and disposition) they want to win, (for ransom) slaves (working for their liberation - mukatab), debtors, (for expenses) on the path of Allah and travelers (who have no means to continue their journey). So Allah established. And Allah is Knowing, Wise ”(Sura al-Tauba, ayat 60). The poor (those who live in poverty) and the poor (those who have nothing) are those who do not have a nisab besides their basic needs. Zakat cannot be paid to a person who has any property in the amount of nisab, minus expenses for basic needs, regardless of whether it is subject to growth or not, since it does not fit the definition of a poor or a beggar. A debtor is one who has property from which it is necessary to pay a debt and does not have a nisab. The traveler, unable to continue the journey. This is someone who was left without funds during his travels and does not have access to funds, even if they have them in his homeland. In other words, this one who is stuck on the road and cannot return home due to the fact that he has no money. Such a person may be paid zakat sufficient for him to be able to return to where he has property. This rule does not apply to the modern traveler if he has access to funds at home through bank cards or other tools.

        "answer": "In Islam, the categories of people for whom zakat is intended or not intended are defined without regard to the nature of their activity. Therefore, zakat can be paid to people who have an income, but they are not able to satisfy their basic needs with this income, or after satisfying them they do not have 85 grams of gold or equivalent property in their hands. It makes no difference whether these people are salary officials, artisans or unemployed. However, since there are scholars who are of the opinion that those who are able to satisfy their own basic needs and the needs of those they are required to support should not receive zakat, even if they do not have property equivalent to nisab, when paying zakat it will be more correct to give preference to the poorer to people.",

        "answer": "The recipients of zakat are registered in the 60th verse of Sura al-Taub. According to which, zakat is basically the right of the poor and needy people. Therefore, according to the Hanafites, it is not acceptable to donate zakat and sadak al-fitr for such charitable purposes as the construction and maintenance of mosques, bridges, roads, schools, springs. Payments made with nyakah zakat, however, without taking into account these principles, are not counted as having taken place. Zakat can be transferred to people who are allowed to receive it, either directly or through intermediaries. There is no difference between whether the intermediary is a natural or legal person. Accordingly, if a charity and public organization delivers the zakat it has collected to the recipients agreed upon in Kurjan, the poor and needy, zakat can be entrusted to these organizations, which are in the status of an intermediary. At the same time, zakat cannot be transferred to organizations that do not deliver these funds to those for whom they are intended, but spend them on construction, lighting, office maintenance, etc. It is important to support organizations serving the public so that they can continue to exist.",

        "answer": "One of the groups that receive zakat is the poor (sura al-Tauba, verse 60). A person can pay zakat both as part of the property to which zakat applies and as part of other equivalent property. Therefore, zakat can be paid to a poor person who marries with the things he needs. The cost of circumcising a child whose guardian is a beggar may also be paid with the intention of zakat. However, it is preferable to give zakat to those in need and leave them the right to spend these funds.",

These associations and foundations can collect zakat on behalf of people who fall into the category of those who are allowed to receive it, in order to treat them, in case they receive a power of attorney from them. In order to collect money for the treatment of minor children in the same way, they must receive a power of attorney from their parents.

If he pays zakat to a person as a result of a certain analysis and the conclusion that the person meets the criteria for the recipient of zakat, but then it turns out that this person is not one of those to whom zakat is intended, then zakat will be counted. Also, zakat will be counted if a person pays it without searching and analyzing, but then it turns out that the recipient still met the relevant criteria. However, if it becomes clear that the recipient is not suitable, then his zakat will not be accepted, the payment will need to be repeated.",
